It addresses the need for a simple, script-based solution for securing sensitive files, especially for non-technical users. The project will allow users to generate and manage encryption keys, encrypt files to prevent unauthorized access, and decrypt them when needed. This is useful for securing confidential files, transferring sensitive data, building backup scripts, working with CI/CD pipelines, and adding extra encryption to files stored on shared servers or cloud buckets.\n",
